<!-- OK GREAT you have come to hang out in the back rooms of the html! 
You'll notice that you didn't see this text on the website from before, 
just like in our javascript I've commented out this section of text, 
in HTML the notation I use to do this might seem a little different, but the technique
is the same, I can just highlight whatever code I want, press cntrl + /  (control + backslash)
and POOF! Go ahead and try it out! -->

            The main purpose of this website is for you to take a look at how I'm organizing things. 
            Explore this website and then take a 
            look at the code underneath it.

            This page will be confusing if you're not reading it as an html file in visual studios code.
            If you haven't already done so go ahead and open that up.

            <b>THE FIRST DIV</b> has an ID of 'div1', with an ID I can now refer to this DIV from either my javascript sketch,
            or my css file. Which is extremely useful.
            Say for instance I wanted to generate language to be added here, or potentially use this Div as a chat window for a Bot, 
            I can now have the front facing elements of my html 
            interwine with the thinking elements of my code in javascript. Similarly, 
            the CSS file allows me style my divs in a more precise and dynamic way - although I can also do this in my html... 
            Which brings us to....

            <b>THE SECOND DIV</b><i>the div inside the div</i>
            As you can see this second <i>nested div</i> does not have an ID, however I am changing the style of the page on the fly.
            The 'font-size' of the page is being changed to 24px

lets navigate over to the style css page and see how we're manipulating the canvas from there -->
